## Hello and Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me ðŸ§‘
I come from a background with past experience using, supporting, and administrating Hyper-V, SharePoint, Citrix, amongst other technologies; however as technology evolves I am as well and have started my journey into a new realm with Cloud and DevOps.  Azure is my main platform of choice for current solutions.  I am looking forward to learning more about Azure (cloud in general), Git, GitHub, DevOps, AzDO, and more.
